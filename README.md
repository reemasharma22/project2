#My project

I created an application that generated a phone deal using 4 services that interacted with eachkther. The services communicated to generate a random deal dependant on the phone and the colour of the phone. 

service 1: This was the front end of the application which communicated with the other services 
service 2: This generated a random phone 
service 3: This generated a random colour
service 4: This generated a price dependant on the phone and the colour
